Container Health - Kubernetes provides a number of features that allow you to buils robust solutions such as ability to automatically restart unhealthy containers. K8s need to know the status of your applications - actively monitoring container health.

Liveness Probes - allow you to automatically determine whether or not a container application is in healthy state.

By default K8s will only consider a container to be down if the container process stops.

Liveness Probes allow you to customize this detection mechanism and make it more sophisticated.

Startup Probes - similar to liveness probes. Liveness probes run constanly on a schedule, startup probes run at container statup and stop running once they succeed.

They are used to determine when the application has sucessfully started up. Usefull for legacy applications that can have long startup times.

Readiness Probes - Used to determine when a container is ready to accept requests. When you have a service backed by multiple endpoints, user traffix will not sent to a particulat pod untill containers have all passed the rediness checks defined by thie rediness probes.

Use rediness probes to prevent user traffic from being sent to pods that are still in the process of starting up.
